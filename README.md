LESS Elements
=============

A set of useful mixins for LESS, the CSS pre-processor: <http://lesscss.org>

More information and usage examples over at: <http://lesselements.com>

TextMate bundle: <https://github.com/juanghurtado/less-elements.tmbundle>

Notice
=============
This is a fork of elements.less, it has different set of mixins but I keep it in sync with original repository.
